      "description": "Van Gogh's intense green eyes directly engage the viewer, creating an immediate psychological connection. The artist often emphasized his eyes in self-portraits, using them as windows into his emotional state. Here, they appear alert and penetrating, set against the reddish tones of his faceâ€”a deliberate complementary color contrast that increases visual intensity."

His left ear is visible and intact, a poignant detail considering the later self-mutilation that would become an iconic part of the artist's biography. This portrait thus captures van Gogh during a relatively stable period of artistic growth and experimentation."
